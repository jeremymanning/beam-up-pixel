# Multi-Device Support

The Beam Up watch face now uses percentage-based positioning to ensure it displays correctly on all Wear OS devices, regardless of screen size or shape.

## Responsive Design Implementation

### Layout Changes
All positioning and sizing now uses percentages instead of pixels:

- **Watch Face Container**: 100% × 100%
- **Time Digits**: Each digit takes 20% width, positioned with proper spacing
- **Font Size**: 26% of screen height for optimal readability
- **Beams**: 16.2% width, 45.3% height
- **Progress Bar**: 100% width, 2.2% height

### Key Improvements

1. **Digit Positioning** (percentage of screen width):
   - Hour tens: 7.3%
   - Hour ones: 26.7%
   - Colon: 46.4% (6.7% width)
   - Minute tens: 52.7%
   - Minute ones: 72.2%

2. **Vertical Positioning**:
   - Time display: 27.5% from top
   - Progress bar: 48.9% from top
   - Date display: 54.7% from top

3. **Animation Scaling**:
   - Beam heights animate from 0% to 100% of their container
   - Progress bar animates from 0% to 100% width

## Testing on Different Devices

The watch face has been tested and works correctly on:

### Round Displays
- **Small (320×320)**: Common on older Wear OS devices
- **Medium (384×384)**: Pixel Watch and similar
- **Large (454×454)**: Galaxy Watch 5/6, TicWatch Pro

### Square Displays
- **Small (280×280)**: Older square watches
- **Medium (340×340)**: Modern square watches

## Benefits

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any Wear OS device
2. **Crisp Display**: Text scales proportionally to screen size
3. **Consistent Layout**: Elements maintain relative positions
4. **Future-Proof**: Will work on new devices with different resolutions

## Technical Notes

- Font sizes use percentage of screen height for consistent readability
- Beam animations scale proportionally to maintain visual impact
- Progress bar thickness scales with screen size
- All timing animations remain consistent across devices

The watch face will automatically adapt to any Wear OS device's screen dimensions while maintaining the original design's aesthetic and functionality.
