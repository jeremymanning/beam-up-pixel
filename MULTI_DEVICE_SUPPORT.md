# Multi-Device Support

The Beam Up watch face is designed to work across all Wear OS devices through the Watch Face Format's automatic scaling system.

## How It Works

### Automatic Scaling
The Watch Face Format (WFF) automatically scales the watch face to fit different screen sizes:

- **Base Design**: Created at 450×450 pixels
- **Scaling**: WFF proportionally scales all elements to fit the target screen
- **Aspect Ratio**: Maintains consistent proportions across devices

### Tested Screen Sizes

The watch face displays correctly on:

1. **Small Round (320×320)**: Scaled to 71% of original size
2. **Medium Round (384×384)**: Scaled to 85% of original size  
3. **Large Round (454×454)**: Scaled to 101% of original size
4. **Square Displays**: Content is centered with minimal edge cropping

## Testing on Different Devices

The watch face has been tested and works correctly on:

### Round Displays
- **Small (320×320)**: Common on older Wear OS devices
- **Medium (384×384)**: Pixel Watch and similar
- **Large (454×454)**: Galaxy Watch 5/6, TicWatch Pro

### Square Displays
- **Small (280×280)**: Older square watches
- **Medium (340×340)**: Modern square watches

## Benefits

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any Wear OS device
2. **Crisp Display**: Text scales proportionally to screen size
3. **Consistent Layout**: Elements maintain relative positions
4. **Future-Proof**: Will work on new devices with different resolutions

## Technical Notes

- Font sizes use percentage of screen height for consistent readability
- Beam animations scale proportionally to maintain visual impact
- Progress bar thickness scales with screen size
- All timing animations remain consistent across devices

The watch face will automatically adapt to any Wear OS device's screen dimensions while maintaining the original design's aesthetic and functionality.
