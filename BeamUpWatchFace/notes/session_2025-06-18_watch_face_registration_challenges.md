# Watch Face Registration Challenge - Session 2025-06-18

## Current Status
- **Working Commit**: d802315 "ðŸš€ COMPLETE BEAM-UP ANIMATION SUCCESS!"
- **Issue**: Watch face displays correctly when launched directly but does NOT appear in the watch face selection list on Wear OS emulator
- **Retro Beam**: Working correctly and appears in watch face list

## What We Tried

### 1. Preview Image Issues
- **Attempted**: Added preview image from retro-beam
- **Result**: No change
- **Discovery**: Both projects had preview images and thumbnail references

### 2. Manifest Configuration
- **Attempted**: Added various service declarations, WFF dependencies
- **Result**: Build failures and still no appearance in list
- **Discovery**: Simpler manifest structure (like retro-beam) works better

### 3. Application ID Conflicts
- **Issue**: Both BeamUp and RetroBeam used same applicationId: `com.example.beamupwatchface`
- **Solution**: Changed BeamUp to `com.example.beamupwatchface.beamup`
- **Result**: Both can coexist, but BeamUp still doesn't show in list

### 4. Missing Files
- **Discovery**: BeamUp was missing `white_bar.xml` drawable that RetroBeam had
- **Action**: Restored white_bar.xml from working commit
- **Result**: No change in watch face list appearance

### 5. Simplified WFF
- **Attempted**: Created minimal watchface.xml with just TimeText
- **Result**: Still no appearance in watch face list

### 6. Directory Structure Comparison
```
RetroBeam (WORKING):
â”œâ”€â”€ AndroidManifest.xml (simple, no service)
â”œâ”€â”€ drawable/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ watch_face_preview.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ white_bar.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ raw/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ watchface.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ xml/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ watch_face.xml (has thumbnail reference)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ watch_face_info.xml (empty)
â””â”€â”€ values/
    â””â”€â”€ strings.xml

BeamUp (NOT WORKING):
â”œâ”€â”€ AndroidManifest.xml (simple, no service) âœ“
â”œâ”€â”€ drawable/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ watch_face_preview.png âœ“
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ white_bar.xml âœ“ (restored)
â”œâ”€â”€ raw/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ watchface.xml âœ“
â”œâ”€â”€ xml/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ watch_face.xml (has thumbnail reference) âœ“
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ watch_face_info.xml (empty) âœ“
â””â”€â”€ values/
    â””â”€â”€ strings.xml âœ“
```

## Key Differences Found
1. **Namespace vs ApplicationId**: May need perfect alignment
2. **Complex WFF Content**: BeamUp has much more complex animations
3. **Package Installation**: Multiple packages installed but only RetroBeam appears

## Current State
- **RetroBeam**: `com.example.beamupwatchface` - WORKING, appears in list
- **BeamUp**: `com.example.beamupwatchface.beamup` - NOT appearing in list
- **Files**: All required files present and matching structure

## Hypotheses for Non-Appearance
1. **WFF Validation**: Complex animations might be causing WFF parser to reject the watch face
2. **Resource References**: Some resource reference might be broken
3. **Caching**: Wear OS might be caching old versions
4. **Timing**: Complex expressions might be causing parsing errors

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Test with RetroBeam's exact watchface.xml** - Replace our complex animation with RetroBeam's content
2. **Check logcat for errors** - Look for WFF parsing errors during installation
3. **Clear Wear OS cache** - Force refresh of watch face list
4. **Binary search approach** - Gradually add complexity to find breaking point

## Working Configuration (RetroBeam)
- Simple manifest (no service)
- Preview image + thumbnail reference
- Basic WFF content
- Unique applicationId

## Lessons Learned
- WFF watch faces are very sensitive to configuration
- Complex animations might prevent registration
- Directory structure matching is necessary but not sufficient
- ApplicationId conflicts cause one to replace the other
